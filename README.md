> <br><br> **Comment:** Hello, after returning from the weekend my computer won't power on. When I press the power button it doesn't do anything, it doesn't make any sounds and there is nothing displayed on the screen. I can't even try turning it on and off again, so I don't know what to do, please help. 

Solution Methodology:
1. Check power cable is correctly plugged in, if plugged into an extension (power bar) check that it hasn't been powered off and check PSU power switch is in ON position.
2. Verify both outlet and power bar are functioning properly, could plug in a known working device to test.
